# GIST-3DR

The GIST-3DR project aims to revolutionize dental implant procedures by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as 3D Augmented Reality (AR) and advanced segmentation models. The primary objective is to automate and personalize implant generation, addressing critical issues like improper dimensions, nerve canal damage, and lack of regional visualization. By utilizing CT scan data, GIST-3DR generates detailed 3D models of oral anatomy, enabling clinicians to visualize, plan, and execute implant surgeries with precision.
